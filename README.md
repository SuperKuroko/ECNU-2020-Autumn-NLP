# NLP
Based on Natural Language Processing course in ECNU.

There are some basic nlp codes which are based on my homework, aiming to record them and share to those who need.


To read or use them you should notice the followings:  
Programming Language: Python3.  
Annotation Language:  mainly Chinese in utf-8,but all the variable names are named on their use.  
File Format: .ipynb That means you may need a  Anaconda3 or Jupyter NoteBook to open it,  rather than Pycharm or IDLE.  
Package:NLTK  To ensure you can run the file, please using pip/conda to install nltk.  [There is a demo.](https://github.com/SuperKuroko/NLP/blob/main/Configuration.pdf)  

I'll also prepare some pdf files to explain the theory of my code, and print the .ipynb files to pdf to make them easy to read.
